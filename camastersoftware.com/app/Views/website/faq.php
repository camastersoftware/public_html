                            This Software has been designed by the team of practising Chartered Accountants.

                            the price by stopping leakages in Professional Billing or Complying timely and avoiding Interest & Penalties. 
                            One can make best use of  time of the Staff by allocating works properly and by getting comparison of Cost of

                            Similarly, in case of works which are completed, they are arranged in the form of Record Registers which can be referred by any one at anytime.

                            This is one more precious advantage of this software over the others. 
                            This Software  requires minimum data entry work of say 5-10 minutes in a day and gives you a multiple information in different form. 
                            The creation of Masters is a once in lifetime job.<br><br>
                            Hence, is it not worth spending 5-10 minutes a day by each employee when we are otherwise working for 8-10 hours a day ?
